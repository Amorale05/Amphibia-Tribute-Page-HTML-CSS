# Amphibia-Tribute-Page-HTML-CSS
Amphibia Tribute Page created with HTML and CSS for freecodecamp Responsive Web Design certification.

The intention of this project was to create a Tribute Page about something I liked. I'm a huge fan of animated shows like this one, so I decided to create a tribute Page for the show usign HTML and CSS.
